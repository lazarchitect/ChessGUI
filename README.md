# ChessGUI
Java GUI-based desktop app to play Chess. Features to implement - piece control logic, account login, netcode to play online, database to save game states and player accounts, per-game movement history 

The game is run on the JavaFX GUI engine. The main class is GameApplication.java. 

RUNNING THE GAME
Currently I only know of running it through IntelliJ with the built-in JavaFX SDK... will have to work on getting it packaged to an exe or jar or something.
